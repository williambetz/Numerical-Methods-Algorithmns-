# False Position
This algorithm is used for finding roots which retains that prior estimate for which the function value has opposite sign from the function value at the current best estimate of the root. In this way, the method of false position keeps the root bracketed.

# LU Factorization
This algorithmn factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of Gaussian elimination and the product sometimes includes a permutation matrix as well. 

# Simpsons
This algorithmn approximates integrals of polynomials up to cubic degree. Simpson's rule is a method for numerical integration, the numerical approximation of definite integrals which uses parabolas to approximate each part of the curve.
